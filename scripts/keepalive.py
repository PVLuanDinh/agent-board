"""Claude Code Stop hook: keep the LEAD agent working instead of idling mid-task.

Why: a lead told to "work continuously" still ends its turn after a status report such as
"I'm starting step 1 now." with no tool call, then sits idle until a human nudges it. A prose
order cannot keep a turn open; a Stop hook can (measured 2026-10-08 on a live lead).

Scope: acts only when the session's env has AGENT_NAME=lead (the agent-board lead convention)
or AGENT_KEEPALIVE=1. Every other session exits 0 at once. Off: AGENT_KEEPALIVE_OFF=1.

Allows the stop when the FINAL paragraph of the last assistant message asks a question ('?')
or names a wait (owner question, blocked, waiting on you / a background task). Only the final
paragraph counts: lead reports often carry a standing "still waiting on you: question #2"
status line mid-message, which must not excuse a stall.

Safety: at most MAX_BLOCKS consecutive blocks per session (counter in the temp dir), then one
stop is allowed and the counter resets. Fails open on any error. Stdlib only.

Install: python scripts/install_keepalive.py   (adds this hook to ~/.claude/settings.json)
